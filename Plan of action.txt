So, the projects has these parts,

Workflow - We will be working on Github and adding all the files required

Externals - We will be making a glove, which will be having 3 colours (clr1, clr2, clr3) on (front, index, middle) 

Here's how, the process will happen -
1. the program will detect the motion of the colour through camera. (using opencv and numpy)
2. Decide the action to take and hit the required key. (pyautogui, win32api, win32con)
The brackets contain the modules to be used.

The second action requires extensive use of low-level python language which is tricky to learn and will take some time to 
implement it.
So, lets now work on first one.
First thing is obvious, you need to learn a little about opencv, ("Programming knowledge" channel on youtube is the best one)

So, the files that I planned are - 
1. motion_detect.py -  This file will detect the motion of the clr1 i.e. of the hand and return the x,y coordinates of 
                       current position.

2. finger_detect.py -  This will detect the presence clr2 and clr3 and return if they are detected

More will be added after discussion.
As I said before, the movement of mouse and pressing of keys in extremely low level task and needs to be studied. 
I have added the links for the same in a separate file.
Let's begin!!
